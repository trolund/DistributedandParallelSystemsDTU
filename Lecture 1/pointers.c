/* pointers.c 

02346, F19, DTU

In this exercise, you need to figure out which one of the two swap-functions to use, and implement said function
There's two prototypes given, and two empty function-calls.
Apart from that, you need to implement a function, that figures out the length of a string, and prints this.

The file is compiled by running gcc pointers.c -o pointers on linux, which is running on the HPC machines at DTU.

The program is called by running e.g. "./pointers string", where string is the string we'll find the length of.
If you don't wish to print the length of the string, ./pointers will run the program without arguments, and the
string printing implementation will not be tested.
